# Date input and output

The task is to write a python program where you ask the user to input a date(day, month and year).
It might be a good idea to ask for this in seperate operations.

Remember to handle use cases such as:
* not a number
* month written as "march", "3" and "03"

The program shall give the following output (use the python module datetime):

* Date in iso-format (YYYY-MM-DD)
* Date in Norwegian format (DD.MM.YYYY)

Further the program must tell the user the week number of the date and day of the week, e.g if the input is 31.03.2024,
the output is: "31.march 2024 was a tuesday in week 13.". Use the python module Calendar for this part of the program.

Put your code in the "date_input_output/answer" folder.
